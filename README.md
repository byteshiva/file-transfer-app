**About**

This is a simple file upload server built with Golang. With this server, you can easily transfer files between your devices over your local network.

**How it works**

When you run the server, it listens on a specified port and waits for incoming file uploads. You can access the server through your browser and upload files using a simple HTML form. The server then stores the uploaded files in the uploads directory, which is automatically created if it does not exist.
